# Week-7 Report

## Topics Covered

### 📘 APIs and RESTful APIs
- Learned the concept of **APIs** (Application Programming Interfaces) and their types.
- Understood **RESTful APIs** and how they work in modern web applications.
- Practiced **fetching and displaying data** using `fetch()` and `axios`.

### ⚙️ UI Optimization Techniques
- Studied techniques to improve application performance:
  - **Lazy Loading**
  - **Code Splitting**
  - **Performance Tuning**

## 🛠️ Hands-On Assignments

### ✅ JavaScript Assignment
- Practiced DOM manipulation and event handling.
### 🧪 JavaScript Font Size Interactivity Assignment
Built three interactive pages using JavaScript to manipulate text size.  
Used `setInterval`, `clearInterval`, and buttons to start, stop, increment, or decrement font size.  
Practiced DOM manipulation, event handling, and styling dynamically.  
Improved control over UI behavior using conditional logic.


### 🌦️ Weather App Project
- Built a **Weather App** using the **OpenWeather API**.
- Fetched real-time weather data and displayed it using dynamic HTML and JavaScript.

## 📌 Summary
This week was focused on understanding external data handling using APIs and applying optimization techniques for better UI performance. Hands-on projects like the Weather App helped solidify the concepts through real-world application.
